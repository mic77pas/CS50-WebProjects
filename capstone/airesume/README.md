# ResumeForge - Simple & Elegant Resume Builder (Now w/ AI!)

**ResumeForge** is a Django-powered resume builder that allows users to register, log in, and create custom resumes. Users can add, edit, and delete work experience, education, and skills ‚Äî then export their completed resume as a downloadable PDF.

This application focuses on usability and responsiveness, using clean Bootstrap styling to provide an intuitive and mobile-friendly interface. It allows users to manage multiple resumes and iteratively improve their content, all within a secure and structured environment.

This project was built as a final capstone for CS50‚Äôs Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It emphasizes usability, security, and clean modelling - with a light layer of AI to enhance user creativity (instead of replacing it) and explore implementation with APIs and Generation.

## üß† Distinctiveness and Complexity

Unlike prior CS50W projects (e.g., social network, e-commerce, mailing site...), **ResumeForge** addresses a highly practical, real-world challenge: helping users present their professional story clearly, consistently, and with minimal friction. The goal is to reduce the friction of formatting and editing while supporting powerful resume customization.

### What makes it distinct:
- Focused on structured resume creation, not social interaction or generic listings
- Uses a multi-model structure (Resume, Experience, Education, Skill) to capture detailed, editable content
- Implements a polished UI with Bootstrap 5, replacing the default Django admin-like experience
- Offers an **optional AI-powered suggestion feature** that users can unlock by providing their own OpenAI API key - no built-in dependency on external services or paid tiers unless provided

### Complexity elements:
- Built using multiple interlinked Django models, with each user‚Äôs data isolated and securely handled
- Incorporates full user authentication (register, login, logout) and protected views
- Clean form integration using Django‚Äôs ModelForm system with Bootstrap widgets for improved UX
- JavaScript-based `fetch()` call to Django routes allows client-side prompts to be sent to the AI route for resume bullet generation
- Includes server-side PDF generation via `xhtml2pdf` using dynamic HTML templates ‚Äî exportable with a single click

The **AI suggestion feature** is intentionally designed to be lightweight and optional. It allows users to enter a short description of their experience and receive up to three suggested bullet points generated by OpenAI. Because the tool requires a user-supplied API key, it avoids hardcoding credentials and protects against misuse (and also helps not to have to pay for the API access myself). This demonstrates how external APIs can be integrated responsibly, and flexibly, without compromising the core UX or privacy.
